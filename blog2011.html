<h2>Howard Springs New Pine Forest</h2>
<h3>Sunday, October 30th, 2011</h3>
<p>Jurgen, Quentin and myself trecked out to the new section of track. We did three laps to help Q train for the Margret River WA - Anaconda Adventure Race.</p>

<p>We started out collecting Jurgen from his place expecting a quick getaway, but Jurgen had other ideas and decided to change his tyres to slicks which would be useless in the forest. After this diversion we finally make it out of town and on our bikes by 5pm. The Contour was great for giving a good idea of what the ride was like. Will think about some better camera positioning and shots over the next couple of weeks.</p>

<h2>Spokes NT Howard Springs Pine Forest Ride</h2>
<h3>Saturday, October 22th, 2011</h3>
<p> The ride got a huge attendance with 27 riders turning up after Mag's from Spokes NT mentioned the magic words "New Track". Quentin and Richard turned up, but alas Mark was stuck on watching the Lanco international SuperSeries Hockey 9's on ABC and not sure what happened to Jurgen. </p>

<p>The new track is opposite from the normal Howard Springs Pine Forest Ride.  After marshalling at the start of the old track we headed down and across the road, along a track and into the new track.   The DORC and Spokes guys have done a huge job cutting and planning this track, adding jumps and some tricky sections. The most noticable difference between the old and new tracks are the long fast sections that follow the treeline rather than weaving and turning all the time. The more riders that go on the track, the better it will get.</p>

<h2>Lee Point Ride - with added drama!</h2>
<h3>Friday, October 21th, 2011</h3>
<p>Went for a ride with NAthan and Quentin as a trainning ride for Q's upcomming Margret River WA - Anaconda Adventure Race. I found a dead tree broken off and across the gully track and thought it would be a great idea to remove it as it would take you off at the neck if you went headlong down the trakc without paying attention.</p>
<p>I snapped off the tree and heard a crack that wasn't good, so turned my head away and was greeted with a springy core of the trunk that the whiteants hadn't gotten to. I was wearing my helmet but got hit in the side of the head and the blood started to flow. I found a large splinter lodged deep into my skin just in front of my ear, so removed it which added more blood...</p>
<p><i>Anyway</i>... We kept on riding along the Blair Witch track then back to CDU. The little adventures you have when on the trail!

<h2>Holmes Jungle ride</h2>
<h3>Sunday, October 9th, 2011</h3>
<p>Got a phone call from Jurgen at 3:30pm saying that he was going for a ride. I thought about it and said I meet up at work in half an hour. From there we were joined by Nathan and headed off on a residential street tour to get to Holmes Jungle.</p>

<p>We left it to Jurgen to lead the way through his latest favorite place to ride, down through dark jungle streaches and across countless metal walk ways and bridges. It proves to be a challenging course with the constant threat of mosquitos if you stop to long.</p>

<h2>CDNP DORC MTB comp</h2>
<h3>Friday, July 31st, 2011</h3>
<p>I did two laps of the 25KM course around Charles Darwin National Park and Hidden Valley. 46 Riders turned up for the 7am starting time, this was done to catch the coolest part of the day. I planned to do only 1 lap, but changed that to two after having a look at the course. This was not to be as easy as I thought. Q and Gary  competed as well and we all were pleased with our performances.</p>

<h2>Lee Point ride during a monsoonal downpour</h2>
<h3>Thursday, January 20th, 2011</h3>
<p>The ride started with a storm front out to sea, overcast and the ground saturated from all the record rain Darwin has been experiencing.   I assumed that the weather would do the same today as it had the day before...   We weren't so fortunate - about half way round the track it came down in bucketloads. Nathan and myself got an interesting ride back!</p>
