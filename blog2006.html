<h2>Palmerston Cmax Projection Room</h2>
<h3>Thursday, December 28, 2006</h3>
Palmerston Cmax was kind enough to let me look at thier projection booth. The array of equipment as kind of a anti-climax as I had thought that it would be alot bigger.   The amplification was the most suprising as it is 5 stereo power amps that drive all the speaker arrays over balanced XLR connectors. The projector is a work of mechanical art. The optical readers pulling the soundtrack off the film are amazing considering all the jittering the feed mechanism does.

<h2>Gaz's Farewell</h2>
<h3>Friday, December 08, 2006</h3>
Gaz got made redundant recently to the shock of everyone at work. We will all miss him. To Gary, Veronica and Ben, we wish you a happy and prosperous future in Canberra.

<h2>Fishing at the Secret Spot - Kakadu</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, August 16, 2006</h3>
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/rivermorning.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/rivermorning.jpg"/></a></p>
It is very beautiful in this part of the world, tranquil and quite cold in the mornings on the water. An electric outboard motor is perfect for crusing around 'sneaking' up on fish and being able to enjoy the great outdoors without choking on two-stroke fumes.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/flowers.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/flowers.jpg" /></a></p>
The wildlife and plants are in Dry Season mode, so there isn't a lot of green out in the forrests and floodplains, but abound the rivers it is like an oasis in the desert, things come to life.

<h2>Day four - Tasmania</h2>
<h3>Saturday, June 9, 2006</h3>
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/reflection.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/reflection.jpg" /></a></p>
Cold morning. Went to Dove lake and walked to Glacier Rock to get a better view. Fantastic. On to Devils@Cradle to see some Tassie Devils and learn about the TDFT (Tassie Devil Facial Tumour) cancer that is effecting about 50% of the population in the east, but hardly any in the west. The guide said this is most likely due to two genetically separate groups. I hope they come up with a solution soon as they are a fantastic animal.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/devil.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/devil.jpg" /></a></p>
Onward to Ben Lomand National Park and the mystical ski village at its summit. We made the turn off at about 4:15pm which worried me as the sun was already showing signs of setting and Father seemed to remember the last bit of the road as being a "goat track"... He wasn't wrong! After a half hour drive we came to "Jacobs Ladder" which is the scariest drive I have ever done. This easily beats the crazyness that is Mt Hotham's 1000ft drops during winter. The drive is on a 20 deg. 'ish switch-back climb that scales about 300m in 1.6km. We made the top to the relief of everyone in the car. There is indeed a village on the top, but it must be one of the lowest patroned places in Australia. Coming down was a slow pace leaving the Outback in manual mode, first gear.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/dovelake.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/dovelake.jpg" /></a></p>
We drove back home to Georgetown via Launceston in the dark. Glad the adventure went without incident and couldn't beleive the gamit of different country we had seen and driven.

This makes Darwin look positively like old Harry Butler was quoted as saying:
"Clapped-out Buffalo country".... I love the NT and the warmth, but Tasmiania is something again. Utterly magic.

<h2>Day Three - Tasmania</h2>
<h3>Saturday, June 8, 2006</h3>
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/boat.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/boat.jpg" /></a></p>
Went on a boat cruise to Sarash Is., Hell's Gate heads, Gordon River and back to Strahan. This left at 9am and returned by 3pm, this only gave us 2 hours to get up to Cradel Mountain in daylight, if you drive at night you take the risk of not only the wildlife but ice. This can be fatal this time of year.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/moss.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/moss.jpg" /></a></p>
We finaly arrived at Cosy Cabins Cradel Mountain by 5:30pm. Opening the cabint door alerted the local Paddy-Melon Wallaby, he came over to investigate and see if we had any food, discusted, he left us to unpack. Dinner was at the Cradel Mountain Lodge for a counter meal of spare ribs and a few beverages. I expect snow any time soon.

<h2>Day two - Tasmania</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h3>
We went through Smithton to Marrawah for lunch and joined the Western Explorer road that runs down the west coast. This is a remote and rugged part of Tassie without much population or sealed road for a good 150km. This may not sound like much for someone comming from the NT, but when it's an island state that has such extreme terrain, you can appreciate the travel times.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/ruins.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/ruins.jpg" /></a></p>
Corinna has a car barge (The Fatman Barge) that carries two vehicles or 1 bus across the Pieman river, beautifully peacful even with the chug of the Barge in the background. You'll need $20 to pay the ferryman (like the song goes) in this case , during the trip over.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/barge.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/barge.jpg" /></a></p>
Zeehan was where we got back onto the bitchumen and had a quick run to Strahan where we stayed for the night at the Cosy Cabins at Azza's Holiday Units.

<h2>Day one - Tasmania</h2>
<h3>Tuesday, June 06, 2006</h3>
We picked up the car from Budget at Launceston Airport and made our way along the north coast. Passing through the Spirit of Tasmania port of Davenport we took the coastal scenic road through Ulverstone and stopped for lunch at Penguin. There are many large houses along this part of the coast built by rich "mainlanders" for dirt cheap prices before the Tassie land boom of the last 3 years or so.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/thenut.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/thenut.jpg" /></a></p>
We stayed the night at Stanley at the Cosy Cabins at Stanley Caravan Park. This is an interesting place, built on the sheltered side of "The Nut" bluff rock, jutting 185m out of the headland.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/thenutchairlift.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/thenutchairlift.jpg" /></a></p>
The following morning Mother and I went on a chairlift ride to the top of the The Nut bluff. We walked to the first lookout then I did the bluff perimeter to discover a depression on the port side of the rock with stands of Pines and other trees, nice place for a picknick (and tiger snakes in the Summer) I'm told.

<h2>This is cold...</h2>
<h3>Sunday, June 04, 2006</h3>
Well, it has been quite a shock to me being in only 13deg.c as a maximum during the day. Sleeping is a novalty, wearing tracksuit top, bottoms, woolen socks and maybe tonight even a woolen beanie.
<p><a href="blogpictures/fullsize/gulls.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" src="blogpictures/gulls.jpg" /></a></p>
Today we went feeding the local "flying rats" - Sea Gulls... They were pretty well behaved and sit on the bonnet of the car peering through the windscreen at you anticipating the next bread throw.
<br>
Gets dark early here, 5:30pm it's pitch black.
